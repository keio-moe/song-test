This project aims to apply comparative and computational methods to improve the fairness and efficiency of music copyright infringement evaluations. We will develop automated techniques such as sequence alignment algorithms (e.g., Savage & Atkinson, 2015) and test them to see how well they can predict past and future legal decisions (e.g., Mullensiefen & Pendzich, 2009).

We will ask you to answer two types of questions “Comparison of Music” and “Comparison of Lyrics “. In Comparison of Music, you will listen to two music from headphone (A: Plaintiff, B: Defendant). You can listen music repeatly. Then you will answer “Similarity” and “Court Judgment”. Similarity asks you how do you feel similarity between A and B. Court Judgment asks you how do you make a judgement as a judge whether product of defendant infringes on copyright of plaintiff. When you make a judgment, please use below. You can listen music repeatly.

“ To find music copyright infringement between plaintiff's and defendant's songs, you must find that the songs are substantially similar. Two works are substantially similar if the original expression of ideas in the plaintiff's (Song #1) copyrighted work and the expression of ideas in the defendant's work (Song #2) that are shared are substantially similar. Original expression are those unique aspects of plaintiff's song that are not common or ordinary to the genre or to music generally. The amount of similarity must be both quantitatively and qualitatively significant, that is the defendant's song copied either a substantial portion of the original expression of the plaintiff's song, or copied a smaller but qualitatively important portion of the plaintiff's song. “

In Comparison of Lyrics, you will answer “Similarity” and “Court Judgment” as same as Comparison of Music. Some of music are displayed “only instrument, no lyrics”. It means that the music have no lyrics. 

The experiment takes about 2 hours.

Please decide at your own discretion if you cooperate with this experiment. If you do not agree to participate in this experiment, you will never suffer any disadvantages. In addition, you can cancel your agreement any time after agreeing once, and there is no disadvantage. When the experiment is discontinued, the data (paper media and electronic files) and analysis results obtained before the cancellation are discarded, and will not be used for further research. However, please be aware that this data cannot be discarded if there is a published analysis result at the time of cancellation request.
